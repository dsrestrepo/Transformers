# Natural Language Processing and Transformers with Examples in R and Python


## Introduction

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformers, providing practical examples and implementations in both R and Python. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Transformers, on the other hand, are a powerful class of deep learning models that have revolutionized various NLP tasks.

In this repository, we will explore the fundamentals of NLP, including text classification, and delve into the world of Transformers using the popular BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. BERT has shown exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, making it an excellent choice for our examples.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **R Notebooks**
   - Introduction to NLP for Text Classification: This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to NLP using R. We will cover text preprocessing, and build a text classification model to classify text into predefined categories.

2. **Python Notebooks**
   - Transformers with BERT for Text Embeddings Visualization: In this notebook, we will use the BERT model to extract text embeddings and visualize them using various techniques like t-SNE or PCA.
   - Text Masking Prediction: This notebook demonstrates how to use a pre-trained BERT model to predict masked words in a sentence. This task is also known as "cloze test" and is used to evaluate the language understanding capabilities of the model.
   - Text Masking Classification: Here, we'll build a text classification model using BERT. Instead of the traditional text classification where the model classifies the entire input, we'll mask some words in the input and ask the model to classify based on the remaining context.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, you need to have R and Python installed on your system. Additionally, we recommend creating separate virtual environments for R and Python to manage dependencies cleanly.

1. **R Environment Setup**
   - Install R: If you don't have R installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [R Project Website](https://www.r-project.org/)
   - Install RStudio (optional but recommended): RStudio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can download it from [RStudio Website](https://www.rstudio.com/).

2. **Python Environment Setup**
   - Install Python: You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Website](https://www.python.org/). We recommend using Python 3.x.
   - Create a virtual environment: After installing Python, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies for the notebooks. You can use `venv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment.
   - Install required Python packages: Navigate to the Python notebooks directory and install the required packages using `pip`

## How to Use This Repository
