Course Overview:

This course provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) specifically tailored for medical applications. The course aims to equip medical professionals with the fundamental concepts and techniques of NLP, along with practical coding examples using the R programming language. By the end of this course, students will gain the necessary knowledge and skills to leverage NLP for clinical text classification and analysis.

Course Goals:

1. To provide an understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for medical applications.
2. To explore the unique challenges and opportunities of working with text data in the healthcare domain.
3. To develop practical skills in text preprocessing, feature engineering, and building NLP models using R programming language.
4. To introduce advanced NLP methods, such as BERT, and their application in clinical text classification.
5. To foster awareness of ethical considerations and responsible AI practices in the context of NLP for medical applications.


## Natural Language Processing

Due to the nature of machine learning models, which primarily consist of mathematical operations and rules, they are primarily designed to process numerical values. However, there are instances where our data sources consist of text from clinical notes, abstracts of papers, social media data, and others. In such cases, how should we handle this type of data?

In this case we will be using a medical abstracts dataset available at the following link: 

https://github.com/sebischair/Medical-Abstracts-TC-Corpus/tree/main

### 1. Install the packages
```{r}
#install.packages("tm")
#install.packages("caret")
#install.packages("randomForest")

library(tm)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(randomForest)
```

### 2. Read the files

In this case we already have the dataset divided into training and evaluation, if it is not divided, the dataset can be divided in the same way as it was done in the previous workshops.

```{r}
# Read train and test data
train_data <- read.csv("Data/medical_tc_train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test_data <- read.csv("Data/medical_tc_test.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Read label mapping data
label_mapping <- read.csv("Data/medical_tc_labels.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Train:
print(head(train_data, 2))

# Test:
print(head(test_data, 2))

# labels:
print(head(label_mapping, 2))

```

```{r}
# Left Join
train_data <- left_join(label_mapping, train_data)
test_data <- left_join(label_mapping, test_data)

# Train:
print(head(train_data, 2))

# Test:
print(head(test_data, 2))
```
To make the problem simpler and faster to compile we are going to use a subset of the original datasets:

```{r}
TRAIN_SUBSET = 1000
TEST_SUBSET = 200

# Get a random subset of the train dataframe
train_data <- train_data[sample(nrow(train_data), size = TRAIN_SUBSET), ]
# Get a random subset of the test dataframe
test_data <- test_data[sample(nrow(test_data), size = TEST_SUBSET), ]
```


```{r}
# Create the histogram using ggplot2
ggplot(train_data, aes(x = condition_name)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Labels",
       x = "label",
       y = "instances") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

### 3. Preprocessing

#### 3.1 Balance tha dataset
```{r}
# Check the current distribution of categories
print('Initial distribution: ')
table(train_data$condition_name)

# Identify the category with the fewest instances
min_instances <- min(table(train_data$condition_name))

# Oversample the dataframe to balance the categories
train_data <- train_data %>%
  group_by(condition_name) %>%
  sample_n(size = min_instances, replace = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

# Check the balanced distribution of categories
print('Final distribution: ')
table(train_data$condition_name)

# Create the histogram using ggplot2
ggplot(train_data, aes(x = condition_name)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Labels After Undersampling",
       x = "label",
       y = "instances") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

#### 3.2 Text Preprocessing

Because text data is data that may contain a lot of noise and is very sparse, the preprocessing stage is very important. For the preprocessing we will follow the following steps:

1. Text Cleaning:

- Remove any irrelevant characters, punctuation marks, symbols, and numbers that don't contribute to the meaning of the text.
- Convert text to lowercase (e.g., "The" to "the").
- Handle contractions (e.g., "won't" to "will not" "can't" to "cannot").

2. Tokenization:

- Split the text into individual words or tokens. This is essential for further analysis and processing.
- Tokenization can be as simple as using whitespace as a delimiter or more advanced methods like Word Tokenization or Subword Tokenization (e.g., using BERT's WordPiece tokenizer).

3. Stopword Removal:

- Remove common words (stopwords) like "the," "is," "and," etc.

4. Stemming and Lemmatization:

- Stemming reduces words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
- Lemmatization transforms words to their canonical form or lemma (e.g., "better" to "good").

In order to avoid data leaks we will do the preprocessing first on the training data and then on the test data.

Let's create a function for the preprocessing:
```{r}
preprocess_corpus <- function(corpus) {
  # Convert text to lowercase
  corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
  # Remove punctuation
  corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
  # Remove stopwords
  corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
  # Stemming the texts
  corpus <- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument)
  
  return(corpus)
}
```

```{r}
# Step 1: Preprocessing for train data:
# Get the Corpus of texts
train_corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(train_data$medical_abstract))
# Preprocessing the Corpus
train_corpus <- preprocess_corpus(train_corpus)
```

Now for the preprocessing of the test dataset, we will use only the documents whose words are also present in the training set:

```{r}
# Step 2: Preprocessing for test data (same as before, but filter words using the train DTM)
test_corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(test_data$medical_abstract))
# Preprocessing the Corpus
test_corpus <- preprocess_corpus(test_corpus)
```
### 4. Encoding

One way to improve the one-hot encoding algorithm and give more context is to use the term frequency of the word in the document. this instead of using 1 or 0 allows us to give a weight to the word depending on the number of appearances in the document

```{r}
train_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(train_corpus)
train_matrix <- as.matrix(train_dtm)

# Filter the test DTM based on the vocabulary in the train DTM
test_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(test_corpus, control = list(dictionary = Terms(train_dtm)))
test_matrix <- as.matrix(test_dtm)
```

### 5. Modeling

Let's test the performance on a random forest model:

```{r}

# Train the Random Forest model
rf_model <- randomForest(train_matrix, train_data$condition_name, ntree = 20)

# Make predictions on the test data
rf_predictions <- predict(rf_model, test_matrix)

# Evaluate the model
confusionMatrix(rf_predictions, test_data$condition_name)
```
